# NTO30102
### Introduce

> This project lays a foundation through the application of Blockchain technology. The main goal of the Group is to create a system to help trace the origin of forest products, especially for the wood sector. This not only helps accurately identify origins, but also ensures transparency and ownership of the supply chain.

> In a world where environmental protection and forest resource management are becoming increasingly important, the group's project is not only an effort to apply new technology but also a social contribution. The team hopes that building such a system will not only help businesses and consumers track the origin of products but also contribute to environmental protection and community development.
